# Hi!
I’m Henrik Soederlund, cofounder and Technical Lead of the award-winning boutique media agency [Creme Digital](https://www.cremedigital.com). I bring deep experience in building and leading effective teams that manage Search, Social, Mobile and Video advertising whilst bringing personal edge expertise in ad performance tracking, implementation & analytics. 

Born a Swede, optimisation and problem-solving is in my genes, demonstrated in the building of agency performance tracking solutions, operational processes and SOPs. The utilisation of a wide technology and systems skillset has enabled our company to manage annual media budgets north of AUD 3M reducing the need of bloated teams.
